    optimize!(tree::BnBTree; callback=(args...; kwargs...)->())
Optimize the problem using a branch and bound approach. 
The steps, repeated until terminated is true, are the following:
```julia
# 1. get the next open node depending on the traverse strategy
node = get_next_node(tree, tree.options.traverse_strategy)
# 2. evaluate the current node and return the lower and upper bound
# if the problem is infeasible both values should be set to NaN
lb, ub = evaluate_node!(tree, node)
# 3. update the upper and lower bound of the node struct
set_node_bound!(tree.sense, node, lb, ub)
# 4. update the best solution
updated = update_best_solution!(tree, node)
updated && bound!(tree, node.id)
# 5. remove the current node
close_node!(tree, node)
# 6. compute the node children and adds them to the tree
# internally calls get_branching_variable and branch_on_variable!
branch!(tree, node)
```
A `callback` function can be provided which will be called whenever a node is closed.
It always has the arguments `tree` and `node` and is called after the `node` is closed. 
Additionally the callback function **must** accept additional keyword arguments (`kwargs`) 
which are set in the following ways:
1. If the node is infeasible the kwarg `node_infeasible` is set to `true`.
2. If the node has a higher lower bound than the incumbent the kwarg `worse_than_incumbent` is set to `true`.
